## Note that you can complete all processes below using phymyadmin

We should create a new mySQL user and grant the privileges
login as admin
>mysql -u root -p

create new user and grant all privilegs
>CREATE USER newuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'user-password';
>grant all privileges on database.* to newuser@localhost;

if you use nodejs mysql vs server' latest mysql, it causes authen problem
see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50093144/mysql-8-0-client-does-not-support-authentication-protocol-requested-by-server
>ALTER USER newuser@localhost IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'user-password';
>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
