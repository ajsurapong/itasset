*** Bug ***
*** DB fields/ some fields must set to nullable coz real data columns are missing
*** DB fields are too small for imported data ex: date in excel contains also time
*** Cannot upload same xlsx file if older file exists, even it is not during checking period
[DONE] *** sql table name and field must be exactly matched (case-sensitive)
*** Date should be server's date
[DONE] ** Delete users and then auto page reload says no user but refresh one more time works (seems to be misplaced getuser())
*** Manage users, admin should not be able to delete or edit other admins
* Manage users, edit admin should show tick at admin's checkbox
[DONE] *** sql error, "/adminhistorytableEmailCommittee/infoshow"
[DONE] *** all file extensions must be small characters ex: images
* Sometimes 'User_history' has no select dropdown for 'year'

*** Minor fixes ***
-Year should be either BE or CE
-Left menubar, instead of hide, should set display:none and show if necessary
[DONE] -First file should be 'index.html'
[DONE] -Is bcrypt required?
[DONE] -DO NOT use non-english filename
-Some alert texts do not match pages
-Remove unnecessary CSS and JS files
-Remove unnecessary services
-code revision: no </html>, too much 'for'
[DONE] -Remove footer in all pages
-Do not mix JS and jQuery if not necessary
-service API name is too long

-QR code must include asset's name
[DONE] -bypass login to a page, fix at profile-routes.js
[TEMP] -404 and 500 pages
-wrong login code is not well managed
-dropdown filter shows 'null' or repeated values when there is only one status

*** Performance and Security ***
-Remove all console.log for non-error ex: testing
-Separate scripts to external JS
[DONE] -Set virtual host (reverse proxy) using Apache or Nginx
[DONE] -Separate static files to be handled by reverse proxy, 
    ex: use "/img/" instead of "img/"
    "/img/" -> localhost/img
    "img/" -> localhost/server_name/img
-Cross-site scripting: try to remove it before using 'helmet'
[DONE] -change all secrete keys to node_env
[DONE] -set node to auto start using pm2
